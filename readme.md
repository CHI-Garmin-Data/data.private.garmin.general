# Garmin General Dataset
A dataset that contains general data from my garmin connect account. Starting from around 2016 and up to 2022.
As of now it is Version 1.0.0 and follows the convention of [Semantic Versioning, 2022](https://semver.org/).
The dataset contains data about blood pressure, sleep, stress, steps walked and more. As of now it only contains 
the fit files and working on a solution to convert it to other formats.
